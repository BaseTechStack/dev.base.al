# BaseDev Projects Overview

BaseDev (formerly known as BaseTechStack) provides a comprehensive ecosystem of frameworks and tools for rapid application development. This page provides an overview of the core projects and how they work together.

## Core Frameworks

### Backend Frameworks

| Framework | Description | Language | License |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| [Base](/projects/base/) | Core framework for building robust and scalable APIs | Go | MIT |
| [BaseQL](/projects/baseql/) | Framework for rapidly building powerful GraphQL servers | Go | MIT |
| [Hex](/projects/hex/) | Lightweight hexagonal architecture framework | Ruby | MIT |

### Frontend Frameworks

| Framework | Description | Language | License |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| [BaseUX](/projects/bux/) | CLI tool and framework for rapid Vue/Nuxt application development | Go/Vue | MIT |
| [BaseUI Flutter](/projects/baseui-flutter/) | UI component library for Flutter applications | Dart | MIT |
| [Vue3 Mindmap](/projects/vue3-mindmap/) | Mindmap component for Vue3 | TypeScript | MIT |

## Development Tools

| Tool | Description | Language | License |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| [Base CMD](/projects/basecmd/) | Command-line tool for Base framework | Go | MIT |
| [BaseORM](/projects/baseorm/) | ORM library for Go applications | Go | GPL-3.0 |
| [BaseUI Flutter CMD](/projects/baseui-flutter-cmd/) | Flutter CLI generator for BaseUI | Go | MIT |

## Ecosystem Integration

The BaseDev ecosystem is designed to work together seamlessly:

- **Backend + Frontend**: Base backend APIs integrate perfectly with BaseUX frontends
- **Cross-Platform**: Build web applications with BaseUX and mobile apps with BaseUI Flutter
- **Code Generation**: Use CLI tools like Base CMD and BaseUI Flutter CMD to accelerate development

## Common Features Across Projects

All BaseDev projects share these common principles:

1. **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults with flexibility to customize
2. **Modularity**: Self-contained components with clear separation of concerns  
3. **Developer Experience**: Tools and patterns that make development enjoyable
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing across all frameworks for reliable code
5. **Code Generation**: Automated scaffolding to reduce boilerplate code
