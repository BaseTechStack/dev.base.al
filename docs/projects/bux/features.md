# BaseUX Features

BaseUX provides a rich set of features to accelerate your Nuxt.js application development. This page offers an overview of the key capabilities that make BaseUX a powerful framework for building modern web applications.

## Entity Generation System

The entity generation system is the core feature of BaseUX, allowing you to scaffold complete CRUD modules with a single command.

### Key Capabilities

- **Complete Structure Generation**: Create models, components, services, and stores
- **Field Type Inference**: Automatically generate appropriate form inputs based on field types
- **Validation Integration**: Built-in validation rules based on field types
- **API Integration**: Pre-configured API services for each entity
- **UI Components**: Ready-to-use grid and table views with sorting and filtering

## Layered Architecture

BaseUX uses Nuxt's layers feature to organize entities as standalone, extendable modules.

### Benefits

- **Modular Development**: Each entity lives in its own self-contained directory
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between different parts of your application
- **Easy Maintenance**: Update entities independently without affecting others
- **Consistent Structure**: Standardized approach to organizing code

## Store Pattern

BaseUX implements a sophisticated store pattern using Pinia that provides:

- **Consistent State Management**: All entities follow the same pattern
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all store operations
- **Composition**: Using Pinia's defineStore with specialized entity methods
- **Flexible API**: Components can use either generic or entity-specific methods

The updated store pattern integrates specialized entity methods directly into the store object, ensuring consistent usage patterns throughout your application.

## UI Component Library

BaseUX includes a comprehensive set of UI components built on top of Nuxt UI:

- **Data Display**: Grid and table components with sorting and filtering
- **CRUD Modals**: Pre-built modals for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting entities
- **Form Components**: Dynamic form generation based on entity fields
- **Layout Components**: Responsive layouts for different device sizes
- **Action Components**: Buttons, menus, and interactive elements

Components support flexible prop naming to enhance reusability across entities, preventing "Missing required prop" warnings while maintaining the expected interface.

## TypeScript Integration

BaseUX is built with TypeScript from the ground up:

- **Type Definitions**: Clear interfaces for all entities and components
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **IntelliSense Support**: Improved developer experience with autocompletion
- **Type Inference**: Automatic type inference for improved productivity

## Service Layer

The service layer acts as an adapter between components and API endpoints:

- **Data Transformation**: Convert between API and frontend data formats
- **API Communication**: Handle HTTP requests and error handling
- **Caching**: Optional caching for improved performance
- **Response Processing**: Standardized processing of API responses

## Responsive Design

All BaseUX components are designed to be responsive by default:

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Components work on all device sizes
- **Responsive Grid**: Automatically adjust layout based on screen size
- **Adaptive UI**: Components adapt to different viewport sizes
- **Touch Support**: Support for touch interactions on mobile devices

## Theme Support

BaseUX includes comprehensive theme support:

- **Light/Dark Mode**: Built-in support for light and dark themes
- **Color Customization**: Easily customize the color palette
- **Theme Variables**: CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Dynamic Themes**: Change themes at runtime

## Development Tools

BaseUX provides tools to improve the development experience:

- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development
- **TypeScript Checking**: Real-time type checking
- **ESLint Integration**: Code quality enforcement
- **Component Development Environment**: Isolated component development

## Multi-Language Support

BaseUX makes it easy to implement multi-language support:

- **i18n Integration**: Built-in internationalization support
- **Language Switching**: Dynamic language switching at runtime
- **Translation Management**: Organized translation files
- **Fallback Languages**: Graceful handling of missing translations

## Authentication and Authorization

Built-in support for authentication and authorization:
