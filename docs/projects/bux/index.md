# BaseUX Framework

BaseUX is a powerful command-line tool and framework designed for rapid development of modern Nuxt.js applications. It provides a complete solution for scaffolding, entity generation, and state management to accelerate your Vue/Nuxt development workflow.

## What is BaseUX?

BaseUX is a framework for rapidly developing Nuxt applications with a focus on modularity, consistency, and developer experience. It combines a powerful CLI tool with a comprehensive set of libraries, components, and patterns designed to accelerate the development of Vue/Nuxt applications. It's not meant to generate Websites but Web applications. It's not a CMS or a Website generator. It's a framework for building Web applications. Still you can have a simple Landing page with a contact form and a blog section inside @/app/pages/.

Even that you can use any api enpoints, it works best with Base. Auth is built-in and works with [Base](/projects/base/).

## Key Components
 
### Framework Core

The BaseUX Framework provides a robust set of features for building modern Nuxt applications:

- **[Entity Generation System](./core/entity-generation)**: Sophisticated scaffolding for complete CRUD modules
- **[Component Library](./core/components)**: Pre-built UI components for rapid interface development
- **[Store Pattern](./core/stores)**: Advanced state management using Pinia with composable patterns
- **[Service Layer](./core/services)**: Clean adapter pattern for API communication
- **[Layouts System](./core/layouts)**: Flexible, reusable application layouts
- **[Type System](./core/types)**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for type safety
- **[Middleware](./core/middleware)**: Route-level authentication and protection

### Command Line Tool

The BaseUX CLI provides tools that supercharge your development workflow:

- **Project Scaffolding**: Create new Nuxt projects with best practices built-in
- **Entity Generation**: Generate complete entity modules with a single command
- **Component Generation**: Scaffold new UI components with proper structure
- **Development Server**: Quick-start your development environment
- **Framework Updates**: Keep your framework components up to date

## Philosophy

BaseUX is built on several key principles:

1. **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults with flexibility to customize
2. **Modular Architecture**: Self-contained entity modules with clear separation of concerns
3. **Complete CRUD Generation**: End-to-end scaffolding from models to UI components
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript support throughout the application
5. **Developer Experience**: Tools and patterns that make development enjoyable
6. **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized approach to common development tasks
