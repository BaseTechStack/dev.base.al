# Introducing Base: A Modern Go Framework for Rapid Development

In today's fast-paced development environment, engineers need tools that enable rapid iteration without sacrificing code quality or maintainability. At BaseCode, we're excited to introduce **Base** — our open-source Go framework designed to accelerate your development workflow while maintaining the structure and organization your projects need to scale.

## Why We Built Base

The Go ecosystem has excellent libraries and components, but integrating them into a cohesive application architecture often requires significant boilerplate and configuration. We built Base to solve this problem by providing:

1. **A cohesive, batteries-included framework** that brings together best-in-class components
2. **Convention over configuration** to reduce decision fatigue and boilerplate
3. **Developer-friendly tooling** that makes common tasks effortless
4. **Modular architecture** that scales with your application complexity

## Key Features and Components

Base follows the Hierarchical Model-View-Controller (HMVC) pattern and comes packed with features designed to address common challenges in modern web development:

### Event-Driven Architecture

Base includes a thread-safe event system that enables loose coupling between components. This makes your code more maintainable and testable:

```go
// Register an event handler
app.Events.On("user.created", func(e events.Event) {
    // Handle the event
    user := e.Data.(models.User)
    SendWelcomeEmail(user)
})

// Trigger the event
app.Events.Emit("user.created", newUser)
```

### Seamless Database Integration

With built-in GORM integration, Base makes database operations straightforward while maintaining the flexibility you need for complex queries:

```go
// Define a model
type Product struct {
    base.Model
    Name        string
    Description string
    Price       float64
    CategoryID  uint
    Category    Category
}

// Create a new product
product := Product{
    Name:        "Ergonomic Keyboard",
    Description: "Comfortable typing experience",
    Price:       99.99,
    CategoryID:  1,
}
app.DB.Create(&product)
```

### Comprehensive Authentication System

Base provides a complete authentication system with JWT tokens, API keys, and fine-grained access control out of the box:

```go
// Create a protected route
app.Router.Get("/profile", middleware.Auth(), func(c *base.Context) {
    user := c.CurrentUser()
    c.JSON(200, user)
})
```

### Powerful Media Management

The integrated media library handles file uploads, transformations, and storage across multiple providers:

```go
// Handle file upload
file, _ := c.FormFile("avatar")
media, _ := app.Media.Store(file, "avatars", map[string]interface{}{
    "user_id": user.ID,
})

// Generate URLs for different variants
avatarURL := media.URL("thumb")
```

### WebSocket Support for Real-time Applications

Building real-time features is simplified with Base's WebSocket system:

```go
// Create a channel
app.WS.Channel("chat", func(socket *ws.Socket) {
    // Handle connection
    socket.On("message", func(data interface{}) {
        // Broadcast to all clients in the channel
        socket.Broadcast("message", data)
    })
})
```

## Developer Experience First

What sets Base apart is its focus on developer experience. The companion CLI tool supercharges your workflow:

```bash
# Create a new project
base new myapp

# Generate a model with relationships
base generate model Product name:string price:float category:belongs_to

# Start the development server with hot reloading
base start -r
```

The CLI handles everything from project scaffolding to code generation, allowing you to focus on your application's unique logic rather than boilerplate.

## Project Structure That Scales

Base encourages a modular architecture that promotes clean code organization:

```
myapp/
├── cmd/            # Application entry points
├── config/         # Configuration files
├── controllers/    # Request handlers
├── models/         # Database models
├── services/       # Business logic
├── events/         # Event handlers
├── middleware/     # HTTP middleware
├── routes/         # Route definitions
├── templates/      # View templates
└── public/         # Static assets
```

This structure provides clear separation of concerns while remaining flexible enough to adapt to your specific needs.

## Built for the Full Development Lifecycle

Base isn't just for prototyping — it's designed to support applications from inception to production:

- **Development**: Hot reloading, helpful error messages, and automatic documentation
- **Testing**: Designed for testability with mocking support and test helpers
- **Deployment**: Production-ready with performance optimization and security best practices
- **Maintenance**: Clean architecture that new team members can quickly understand

## The Base Ecosystem

Base is part of a larger ecosystem of tools developed by BaseCode:

- **BaseUX**: A Vue/Nuxt.js framework that seamlessly connects to Base APIs
- **BaseQL**: A GraphQL framework that extends Base with powerful query capabilities
- **BaseUI Flutter**: A Flutter component library for building mobile apps that connect to your Base backend

These tools work together to provide a consistent development experience across backend, frontend, and mobile applications.

## Getting Started
